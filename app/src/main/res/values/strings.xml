    <string name="explanation">So, how does this program work you may ask? Quite simple actually! After reverse engineering the Tesla Bluetooth Low Energy API, I realised that there was a simple mistake made by the developers, an option that they possibly didn\'t intend to release. That is, remote start. The problem is that over Bluetooth, it doesn\'t require your account password. This makes up for a simple attack; you simply add your phone key, and then remote start the car over Bluetooth (the owner <i>does</i> get a notification that the key was added though)</string>
    <string name="wait">Please wait for the app to do its thingâ€¦ if you\'ve been here for a minute or so, something\'s definitely gone wrong; try restarting the app or drop me an email! (I tried to fix it not connecting to the car, but <u>sometimes</u> it still just doesn\'t :/)</string>
